# Git Best Practices

There's a lot to learn about using Git, but it's worth taking the time to highlight some best practices:

- Git is helpful when collaborating with others and when working independently.
- Two helpful best practices are atomic commits and meaningful commit messages.
- Consider atomic commits as changes related to only one feature or task for easier reversion and better messages.
- Write concise yet descriptive one-line summaries and, if needed, more detailed explanatory text for commit messages.
- Git commit message editor can be changed, especially if you prefer using Visual Studio Code.

Remember, mastering these practices will make you a more effective collaborator and developer.
