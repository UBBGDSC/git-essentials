# Git Best Practices

Using Git effectively can greatly enhance your development workflow. Here are some valuable best practices to consider:

## Collaborative and Independent Work

Git serves you well whether you're collaborating with a team or working solo. It's versatile and adapts to different scenarios.

## Atomic Commits

**Atomic commits** are a fundamental concept in Git. They involve making small, focused commits that encapsulate a single change. This practice makes it easier to manage your project and maintain a clear history. For example, if you're working on a web application and you fix a bug related to user authentication, create a separate commit for it:

```
- Fix user authentication bug
```

## Meaningful Commit Messages

A well-crafted commit message is a crucial aspect of Git best practices. It should provide a clear and concise summary of your changes. Additionally, include a more detailed explanation when necessary. Here's an example of a meaningful commit message:

```
- Implement new feature for user profile
  - This commit adds a user profile page with user details and profile picture functionality. It addresses issue #123.
```

## Customizing Git Commit Message Editor

Git allows you to customize your commit message editor. If you prefer using Visual Studio Code, you can set it as your default editor for Git commit messages. To do this, run the following command:

```
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
```

This command configures Git to use Visual Studio Code as the default commit message editor.
