## Git Basics

### Key Concepts

- **Repository:** A hidden directory that stores all project files, directories, and their complete history. It's essential for collaborative development, allowing multiple developers to work simultaneously on a project. Repositories can be local, shared, or remote.
- **Commit:** A snapshot of changes made to the repository at a specific time, forming a permanent record. Each commit is uniquely identified by a hash and contributes to the repository's commit history.
- **Branch:** An independent line of development, enabling isolated work on features or bug fixes. It points to a specific commit and aids in organizing changes and maintaining a clean project history.

## Git Workflow

**Overview of a typical Git workflow:**

- **Working Directory:** Where changes to files occur, monitored by Git to track modifications. Also known as the "working tree" or "working copy".
- **Staging Area:** A space to prepare and review changes before committing. Also known as the "index" or "cache". It stores information about the next commit.
