# Git Introduction

## What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system that enables collaboration, tracking changes, and managing projects efficiently. It's a system that records changes to files over time, allowing specific versions to be recalled later. Consider a scenario where developers work simultaneously on a project, each adding code on their local machines and pushing changes to a remote repository. How do they keep track of changes, determine the latest version, or identify who made specific changes? Version control comes into play, enabling developers to track changes, collaborate, and manage project history. Among the available version control systems, Git, developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, is the most widely used.

## Why Git?

Git offers functionality, performance, security, and flexibility that meet the needs of most teams and individual developers. Its distributed nature ensures the entire codebase and history reside on each developer's machine, allowing for easy branching and merging. Being the de facto standard, many developers and college graduates possess Git experience. Moreover, as an open-source project, Git benefits from robust support and continuous improvements. Its learn-once-use-everywhere design, simple and consistent command line interface, and flexibility for diverse workflows make it a highly adaptable version control system.
